# Shiam OS – Operating Systems Lab Assignment  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains implementations of various **Operating System concepts** using Python. The experiments are part of lab assignments for understanding **process creation, management, and scheduling**.  

Each task demonstrates fundamental OS-level operations such as creating processes, executing commands, handling zombie/orphan processes, inspecting process information, and managing process priorities.

## 🧪 Experiments  

### 🔹 Task 1: Process Creation Utility  
- Demonstrates process creation using the **Python `os` module**.  
- Covers `fork()` and process handling basics.  

### 🔹 Task 2: Command Execution using `exec()`  
- Executes system commands from Python programs.  
- Uses `os.exec*()` functions to replace processes with new ones.  

### 🔹 Task 3: Zombie & Orphan Processes  
- Simulates zombie and orphan process creation.  
- Explains how the parent/child process lifecycle affects system resources.  

### 🔹 Task 4: Inspecting Process Info from `/proc`  
- Extracts and inspects process details directly from the **Linux `/proc` filesystem**.  
- Provides insights into running processes.  

### 🔹 Task 5: Process Prioritization  
- Demonstrates setting and changing process priorities.  
- Explains how process scheduling is influenced by priority.
